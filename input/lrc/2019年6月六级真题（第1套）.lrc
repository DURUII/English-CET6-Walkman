[00:02.54]College English Test Band Six
[00:05.40]Part ¢ò Listening Comprehension
[00:09.25]Section A
[00:10.77]Directions: In this section, 
[00:13.37]you will hear two long conversations. 
[00:16.19]At the end of each conversation, 
[00:18.17]you will hear four questions. 
[00:20.62]Both the conversation and the questions 
[00:22.89]will be spoken only once. 
[00:25.21]After you hear a question, 
[00:27.29]you must choose the best answer 
[00:29.04]from the four choices 
[00:30.23]marked A), B), C) and D). 
[00:33.79]Then mark the corresponding letter 
[00:35.58]on Answer Sheet 1 
[00:37.40]with a single line through the centre.
[00:40.60]Conversation One
[00:42.45]W: Hi, my name is Kathy. 
[00:44.34]Nice to meet you!
[00:45.82]M: Nice to meet you, too, Kathy. 
[00:47.70]My name is John. 
[00:49.32]I'm a university friend of the bride. 
[00:52.10]What about you? 
[00:53.45]Who do you know at this party?
[00:55.30]W: I am a colleague of Brenda. 
[00:56.85]I was a little surprised to be invited, 
[00:59.42]to be honest.
[01:00.43]We've only been working together 
[01:01.86]the last six months, 
[01:03.39]but we quickly became good friends. 
[01:06.14]We just wrapped up a project 
[01:07.76]with a difficult client last week. 
[01:10.32]I bet Brenda is glad it's done with, 
[01:12.46]and she can focus on wedding preparations.
[01:15.66]M: Oh, yes. 
[01:16.64]So you're Kathy from the office. 
[01:19.39]Actually, I've heard a lot about you and that project. 
[01:22.98]The client sounded like a real nightmare!
[01:25.96]W: Oh, he was. 
[01:27.14]I mean we deal with all kinds of people 
[01:29.58]on a regular basis. 
[01:31.14]It's part of the job, 
[01:32.72]but he was especially particular,
[01:34.76]enough about that. 
[01:36.60]What line of work are you in?
[01:38.53]M: Well, right out of college, 
[01:40.11]I worked in advertising for a while. 
[01:42.82]Recently, though, 
[01:43.77]I turn my photography hobby 
[01:45.57]into a small business.
[01:47.52]I'll actually be taking photos 
[01:49.43]during the big event as a wedding gift.
[01:52.05]W: That sounds wonderful and very thoughtful of you. 
[01:55.41]I bake, just as a hobby. 
[01:57.71]But Brenda has asked me to do the cake
[01:59.89]for the wedding.
[02:01.10]I was a bit nervous saying yes, 
[02:03.13]because I'm far from a professional.
[02:05.70]M: Did you bake the cookies here 
[02:07.14]at the party tonight?
[02:08.49]W: Yes, I got the idea from a magazine.
[02:11.14]M: They're delicious! 
[02:12.72]You've got nothing to worry about. 
[02:14.67]You're a natural.
[02:15.90]W: You really think so?
[02:17.56]M: If you hadn't told me that, 
[02:18.92]I would have guessed they were baked 
[02:20.68]by the restaurant.
[02:22.11]You know, with your event-planning experience, 
[02:25.02]you could very well open your own shop.
[02:28.43]W: Ha, ha! One step at a time. 
[02:30.10]First, I'll see how baking the wedding cake goes. 
[02:33.50]If it's not a disaster, 
[02:35.13]maybe I'll give it some more thought.
[02:38.37]Questions 1 to 4 are based on the 
[02:40.49]conversation you have just heard.
[02:43.90]1. What did Kathy and Brenda 
[02:47.02]finish doing last week?
[03:01.81]2. What is John going to do for Brenda?
[03:18.81]3. How did Kathy feel 
[03:22.04]when asked to bake the cake?
[03:36.83]4. What does the man suggest the woman do?
[03:53.92]Conversation Two
[03:56.53]M: You are heading for a completely different world 
[03:58.82]now that you are about to graduate from high school. 
[04:01.67]W: I know it's the end of high school, 
[04:03.85]but many of my classmates 
[04:05.39]are going on to the same university 
[04:07.98]and we are still required to study hard. 
[04:10.78]So what's the difference? 
[04:12.88]M: Many aspects are different here at university.
[04:16.19]The most important one is 
[04:18.13]that you have to take more individual 
[04:20.81]responsibility for your actions. 
[04:23.82]It's up to your own self-discipline 
[04:26.15]how much effort you put into study. 
[04:29.16]Living in college dormitories, 
[04:31.15]there are no parents to tell you 
[04:33.12]to study harder or stop wasting time. 
[04:36.52]Lecturers have hundreds of students, 
[04:39.30]and they are not going to follow you up 
[04:41.68]or question you if you miss their lectures. 
[04:44.49]W: Nobody cares, you mean?
[04:46.79]M: It's not that nobody is concerned about you.
[04:49.69]It's just that suddenly at university 
[04:52.18]you are expected to behave like an adult. 
[04:55.37]That means concentrating on the direction 
[04:57.75]of your life in general 
[04:59.57]and your own academic performance specifically.
[05:03.02]W: For example?
[05:04.89]M: Well, like you need to manage your daily, 
[05:07.42]weekly and monthly schedules 
[05:10.07]so that you will study regularly. 
[05:12.58]Be sure to attend all classes 
[05:14.75]and leave enough time 
[05:15.74]to finish assignments and prepare well 
[05:18.10]for examinations. 
[05:19.88]W: Okay, and what else is different?
[05:23.04]M: Well, in college, 
[05:24.78]there are lots of distractions 
[05:27.25]and you need to control yourself.
[05:29.93]You will make interesting friends, 
[05:31.93]but you need only keep the friends 
[05:34.28]who respect your student commitments.
[05:37.32]Also, there are a lot of wonderful clubs, 
[05:40.51]but you shouldn't allocate too much time 
[05:43.29]to club activities, 
[05:44.90]unless they are directly related to your study. 
[05:48.59]It's also your choice 
[05:50.31]if you want to go out at night, 
[05:52.45]but you will be foolish to let that 
[05:54.46]affect your class performance 
[05:56.22]during the day.
[05:57.89]W: Well, I'm determined to do well 
[05:60.00]in university and I guess 
[06:01.80]I am going to have to grow up fast.
[06:05.20]Questions 5 to 8 are based on the conversation 
[06:08.54]you have just heard.
[06:10.99]5. What does the man say 
[06:13.96]about college students 
[06:15.67]as compared with high schoolers?
[06:30.71]6. What are college students expected to do 
[06:34.58]according to the man?
[06:49.47]7. What kind of friends does the man suggest 
[06:53.35]the woman make as a college student?
[07:08.93]8. What kind of club activities
[07:12.25]should college students engage in
[07:14.34]according to the man?
[07:29.19]Section B
[07:30.48]Directions: In this section, 
[07:33.13]you will hear two passages. 
[07:35.39]At the end of each passage, 
[07:37.05]you will hear three or four questions. 
[07:40.23]Both the passage and the questions 
[07:42.07]will be spoken only once. 
[07:44.98]After you hear a question, 
[07:46.50]you must choose the best answer 
[07:48.28]from the four choices 
[07:49.51]marked A), B), C) and D). 
[07:52.77]Then mark the corresponding letter 
[07:54.77]on Answer Sheet 1 
[07:56.59]with a single line through the centre.
[08:00.11]Passage One
[08:02.58]Most successful people are unorthodox persons 
[08:05.65]whose minds wander outside 
[08:07.73]traditional ways of thinking. 
[08:10.66]Instead of trying to refine old formulas, 
[08:13.77]they invent new ones. 
[08:16.55]When Jean-Claude Killy made
[08:18.72]the French National Ski Team 
[08:20.61]in the early 1960s, 
[08:23.14]he was prepared to work harder 
[08:24.82]than anyone else to be the best. 
[08:28.74]At the crack of dawn 
[08:30.05]he would run up the slopes with his skis on, 
[08:33.25]an unbelievably backbreaking activity. 
[08:37.25]In the evening, 
[08:38.30]he would do weightlifting and running. 
[08:41.33]But the other team members were working 
[08:43.11]as hard and long as he was. 
[08:46.72]He realized instinctively 
[08:48.65]that simply training harder 
[08:50.51]would never be enough. 
[08:53.32]Killy then began challenging the 
[08:55.19]basic theories of racing technique. 
[08:59.38]Each week 
[09:00.12]he would try something different to see 
[09:02.11]if he could find a better, 
[09:03.57]faster way down the mountain.
[09:07.02]His experiments resulted in a new style 
[09:09.73]that was almost exactly opposite 
[09:12.23]the accepted technique of the time. 
[09:15.92]It involved skiing with his legs apart 
[09:18.27]for better balance and sitting back 
[09:21.11]on the skis when he came to a turn. 
[09:24.61]He also used ski poles 
[09:26.11]in an unorthodox way
[09:28.18]to propel himself as he skied. 
[09:31.66]The explosive new style helped cut 
[09:34.25]Killy's racing time dramatically. 
[09:37.43]In 1966 and 1967, 
[09:40.90]he captured virtually every major skiing trophy.
[09:45.31]The next year, he won three gold medals 
[09:47.55]in the Winter Olympics, 
[09:49.58]a record in ski racing 
[09:51.48]that has never been topped. 
[09:54.77]Killy learned an important secret 
[09:56.79]shared by many creative people: 
[09:59.36]innovations don't require genius, 
[10:03.07]just a willingness to question the way 
[10:05.54]things have always been done.
[10:08.42]Questions 9 to 11 are based on 
[10:10.77]the passage you have just heard.
[10:13.63]9. What does the speaker say 
[10:16.46]about most successful people?
[10:32.26]10. What does the speaker say 
[10:35.19]about Killy's experiments?
[10:50.35]11. What is said to be Killy's biggest honor 
[10:54.23]in his skiing career?
[11:08.99]Passage Two
[11:10.52]Scientific experiments have demonstrated 
[11:13.26]incredible ways to kill a guinea pig, 
[11:16.59]a small furry animal. 
[11:18.87]Emotional upsets generate 
[11:20.56]powerful and deadly toxic substances.
[11:24.71]Blood samples taken from persons experiencing 
[11:27.84]intense fear or anger 
[11:30.16]when injected into guinea pigs 
[11:31.95]have killed them in less than two minutes. 
[11:35.85]Imagine what these poisonous substances 
[11:38.22]can do to your own body.
[11:41.11]Every thought that you have 
[11:42.57]affects your body chemistry 
[11:44.58]within a split second. 
[11:47.34]Remember how you feel  
[11:48.69]when you're speeding down the highway 
[11:50.88]and a big truck suddenly brakes twenty meters 
[11:53.86]in front of you. 
[11:55.69]A shock wave shoots through your whole system.
[11:59.07]Your mind produces instant reactions in your body. 
[12:03.34]The toxic substances that fear, anger, 
[12:06.38]frustration and stress produce 
[12:09.47]not only kill guinea pigs 
[12:11.55]but kill us off in a similar manner.
[12:15.14]It is impossible to be fearful, anxious, 
[12:18.22]irritated and healthy at the same time. 
[12:22.49]It is not just difficult; it is impossible. 
[12:25.75]Simply put, your body's health is a reflection 
[12:28.94]of your mental health. 
[12:31.11]Sickness will often then be a result of 
[12:34.04]unresolved inner conflicts 
[12:36.36]which in time show up in the body.
[12:39.95]It is also fascinating how our 
[12:42.14]subconscious mind shapes our health. 
[12:46.09]Do you recall falling sick on a day 
[12:48.40]when you didn't want to go to school? 
[12:51.09]Headaches brought on by fear? 
[12:53.94]The mind-body connection is such that if, 
[12:57.11]for example, we want to avoid something,
[13:00.66]very often our subconscious mind will arrange it. 
[13:05.15]Once we recognize that these things 
[13:07.10]happen to us, we are halfway to doing 
[13:09.57]something about them. 
[13:12.54]Questions 12 to 15 are based on the passage 
[13:15.56]you have just heard.
[13:17.85]12. What happens to guinea pigs 
[13:20.95]when blood samples of angry people 
[13:23.08]are injected into them? 
[13:37.61]13. What does the speaker say 
[13:40.72]about every thought you have?
[13:55.68]14. What does the speaker say is impossible? 
[14:13.11]15. What does the passage say 
[14:16.09]about our mind and body?
[14:31.03]Section C
[14:32.65]Directions: In this section, 
[14:35.14]you will hear three recordings of lectures 
[14:37.50]or talks followed by three or four questions. 
[14:42.09]The recordings will be played only once. 
[14:45.19]After you hear a question, 
[14:46.95]you must choose the best answer 
[14:48.65]from the four choices 
[14:49.84]marked A), B), C) and D). 
[14:53.65]Then mark the corresponding letter 
[14:55.74]on Answer Sheet 1 with a single line 
[14:58.59]through the centre.
[15:01.01]Recording One
[15:03.89]Teachers and students alike have experienced 
[15:06.45]the curious paradox that beginners, 
[15:08.94]as a rule, tend to think too little about 
[15:12.09]what they are doing 
[15:13.93]because they think too much 
[15:15.93]about what they are doing. 
[15:18.39]Take, for example, people 
[15:20.02]who are learning to play basketball or the piano.
[15:23.65]They have to give so much thought and attention 
[15:26.47]to the low-level mechanics of handling 
[15:28.97]the ball or fingering the keys 
[15:31.21]or reading the music, 
[15:33.08]that they are unable to give any thought 
[15:35.33]to the thing that matters¡ªthe game, 
[15:38.48]or the music, respectively.
[15:40.83]With experts, 
[15:41.76]it's just the other way around. 
[15:44.23]They're open to the tactical possibilities 
[15:46.55]and the musical challenges precisely 
[15:48.82]because they're freed, through skill, 
[15:51.55]from the need to pay attention 
[15:52.98]to the low-level details of how to play. 
[15:56.85]Indeed, when the expert pays attention
[15:59.62]to the mechanics, 
[16:00.97]this is liable to disrupt performance. 
[16:04.29]This has led some to say that the expert operates
[16:07.99]in a zone ¡°beyond thought,¡±
[16:10.21]in a state of flow. 
[16:12.94]But this is misleading. 
[16:15.01]Expert performance is not beyond thought.
[16:18.58]Smart basketball players or skilled musicians 
[16:21.83]need to pay close attention to the demands 
[16:24.23]of high performance, to the challenges 
[16:27.16]to be overcome. 
[16:29.78]What they don't need to do¡ª
[16:31.22]what would be a distraction¡ª
[16:33.49]is to have to think about 
[16:34.81]where their fingers are, 
[16:36.52]or how to control the ball while running. 
[16:40.18]It's not mechanics, 
[16:41.75]but the play itself, 
[16:43.37]that absorbs the expert's intelligence.
[16:46.89]A nice video published online last month 
[16:50.12]sheds light on expertise 
[16:52.12]and the conscious mind. 
[16:54.66]The video reports a new study 
[16:56.49]using an eye-tracking device. 
[16:59.76]It turns out that the less-skilled pianist 
[17:02.56]spends more time looking at her fingers 
[17:05.32]than does the expert who, in contrast, 
[17:08.14]is more likely to be looking at the sheet music, 
[17:11.94]or looking ahead at keys he's not yet playing. 
[17:16.16]In general, the expert's gaze 
[17:18.25]was calmer and more stable.
[17:21.07]This is not a surprising finding.
[17:24.04]It supports what we might almost think of 
[17:26.30]as conventional wisdom. 
[17:29.34]But it's remarkable for all that, nonetheless. 
[17:33.21]The eye tracker gives expert and learning 
[17:35.63]performers a glimpse into 
[17:37.50]what they do without thinking about it. 
[17:41.00]The topic of the nature of skill¡ª
[17:43.02]and the differences between 
[17:44.45]beginners and experts¡ª
[17:46.42]has been one of considerable discussion 
[17:48.92]in cognitive science and philosophy.
[17:52.49]Questions 16 to 18 are based on 
[17:55.01]the recording you have just heard.
[17:58.21]16. What does the speaker say 
[18:01.64]about beginners and expert pianists?
[18:18.22]17. What do smart basketball players do 
[18:22.73]according to the speaker?
[18:37.73]18. What do we learn about the new study 
[18:41.44]published in an online video?
[18:57.02]Recording Two
[18:59.08]Every summer, 
[19:00.06]when I top up my selection of summer outfits 
[19:03.09]from the department stores, 
[19:05.04]my eyes would nearly pop out of my head.
[19:08.96]I'm overwhelmed with a wide range of different 
[19:11.85]slimming products each year. 
[19:14.51]And more shockingly, these products are 
[19:16.92]often advocated by very slim models. 
[19:21.19]Having lived in Asia for almost 10 years now, 
[19:24.46]I've seen various dieting tips come and go. 
[19:28.71]I remember in Japan, 
[19:30.40]people heading directly 
[19:32.24]to the fruit section in the supermarket 
[19:34.96]when the banana diet was at its peak. 
[19:38.62]Then there was the black tea and oolong tea diet, 
[19:43.33]followed by the soybean diet 
[19:45.61]and the tomato juice diet. 
[19:48.35]The list goes on and on. 
[19:51.36]Apart from what people eat, 
[19:53.47]I've also seen many 
[19:55.01]interesting slimming products.
[19:56.98]In Hong Kong, 
[19:58.60]I've seen girls wrapping their whole body 
[20:01.54]or both legs up with a special type of slimming tape 
[20:06.54]which is supposed to help make them thinner. 
[20:09.92]But it just reminded me of the roasted 
[20:12.39]ham my mother usually puts 
[20:14.03]on the dinner table at Christmas. 
[20:17.36]Then there were the face slimming rollers 
[20:20.64]that were said to improve your blood circulation
[20:24.19]and make your face smaller. 
[20:27.17]Personally, I do not believe in 
[20:29.32]any of these slimming gadgets and I think 
[20:32.54]I have a very different perspective 
[20:35.09]when it comes to the definition 
[20:36.91]of what is beautiful. 
[20:40.36]Asian women prefer to avoid the sun, 
[20:43.32]because being pale or white is considered 
[20:46.32]beautiful, whereas a tanned complexion 
[20:49.69]is considered much more 
[20:51.36]beautiful and sexy in the West.
[20:54.10]It is most certainly shaped 
[20:56.10]by a person's culture as well as
[20:58.71]how they were raised in their childhood. 
[21:01.83]As each summer season approaches, 
[21:04.04]there's no escape from it. 
[21:07.05]But it's not only women 
[21:08.32]who are affected by this pressure to look good. 
[21:11.95]Men aspire to be able to show off their six packs 
[21:15.51]or their V-shaped backs, 
[21:17.81]and there's a growing market 
[21:19.51]of slimming pills aimed at men too. 
[21:23.37]I think no matter what diets we follow 
[21:25.78]or what slimming products 
[21:27.20]we obsess ourselves with, 
[21:29.82]at the end of the day there's no magic trick 
[21:33.17]to shape up for the summer. 
[21:35.59]Eat in a balanced way and incorporate
[21:38.36]the right level of physical activity. 
[21:41.41]For me, this still seems to be the best plan. 
[21:46.52]Questions 19 to 21 are based 
[21:48.98]on the recording you have just heard.
[21:52.23]19. What overwhelms the speaker 
[21:55.96]when she buys her summer outfits each year?
[22:11.74]20. What does the speaker think of girls 
[22:15.46]wrapping their legs up with slimming tape? 
[22:31.20]21. What does the speaker think 
[22:34.67]affects people's interpretation of beauty? 
[22:50.65]Recording Three
[22:53.15]Skin may seem like a superficial human attribute, 
[22:56.99]but it's the first thing we notice 
[22:58.61]about anyone we meet. 
[23:01.02]As a zoologist focusing on the studies 
[23:03.56]of apes and monkeys, 
[23:05.52]I've been studying why humans evolved 
[23:07.72]to become the naked ape, 
[23:09.91]and why skin comes in so many different shades 
[23:12.65]around the world. 
[23:15.60]We can make a very good estimate 
[23:17.21]from the fossil record 
[23:18.68]that humans probably evolved 
[23:20.66]naked skin around 1.5 million years ago,
[23:25.11]and meanwhile they mostly lost their coat of fur. 
[23:29.95]Today we have a few patches of hair 
[23:32.30]remaining on various parts of our bodies. 
[23:35.51]But compared with apes and monkeys, 
[23:37.81]we have very little.
[23:39.94]Basically, we turned our skin darker 
[23:42.44]to serve as a natural sun protector 
[23:45.37]in the place of the hair we lost.
[23:48.55]We think we lost this hair 
[23:49.96]because of the need to keep ourselves cool 
[23:52.38]when we were moving around vigorously 
[23:54.63]in a hot environment. 
[23:57.14]We can't really lose heat 
[23:58.75]by breathing quickly and loudly like dogs. 
[24:01.91]We have to do it by sweating. 
[24:04.37]So we evolved the ability to sweat plentifully 
[24:07.57]and lost most of our fur. 
[24:10.68]Most animals protect themselves 
[24:12.48]from the sun with fur.
[24:14.91]What we did in our ancestry was to produce 
[24:17.98]more permanent natural coloring in our skin cells. 
[24:22.37]This was really an important revolution 
[24:24.54]in human history because it allowed us 
[24:27.38]to continue to evolve in equatorial environments. 
[24:32.09]It really made it possible for us 
[24:33.98]to continue along the path 
[24:35.88]toward modern humans in Africa. 
[24:39.78]For most of human history, we all had dark skin. 
[24:44.13]What we see today is the product 
[24:46.10]of evolutionary events resulting 
[24:48.60]from the dispersal of a few human populations 
[24:52.35]out of Africa around 60,000 to 70,000 years ago. 
[24:58.21]Our species originated around 200,000 years ago 
[25:02.95]and underwent tremendous diversification¡ª
[25:06.32]culturally, technologically, 
[25:08.50]linguistically, artistically¡ª
[25:11.66]for 130,000 years.
[25:15.21]After that, a few small populations left Africa 
[25:19.23]to populate the rest of the world. 
[25:22.59]These early ancestors of modern Eurasians 
[25:25.82]dispersed into parts of the world
[25:27.88]that had more seasonal sunshine 
[25:30.15]and much lower levels of sun radiation. 
[25:34.28]It's in these populations 
[25:35.74]that we begin to see real changes 
[25:38.26]in the genetic makeup of natural coloring. 
[25:41.89]Today, skin color is evolving 
[25:44.14]in the new mixtures of people 
[25:46.30]coming together and having children 
[25:48.31]with new mixtures of skin color genes. 
[25:52.16]We can see this in almost 
[25:53.77]every large city worldwide. 
[25:56.48]Not only the coloring genes 
[25:58.29]but lots of other genes are getting mixed up, too.
[26:03.31]Questions 22 to 25 are based on the recording 
[26:07.06]you have just heard.
[26:09.53]22. What does the speaker mainly talk about? 
[26:27.27]23. What had probably caused humans 
[26:31.84]to lose most of their hair 1.5 million years ago? 
[26:49.92]24. What does the speaker say protected 
[26:53.90]early humans from the sun?
[27:09.35]25. What happened after humans migrated
[27:13.99]from Africa to other parts of the world?
[27:30.23]This is the end of listening comprehension.
