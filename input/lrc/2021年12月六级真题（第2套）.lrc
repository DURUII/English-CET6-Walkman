[08:02.11]The saying “blind as a bat” simply isn't correct.<ch> “像蝙蝠一样瞎”的说法根本不正确。
[08:06.64]The truth is that all 1,100 bat species can see and often their vision is pretty good, although not as excellent as other night-hunting animals.<ch>事实上，蝙蝠共有1,100多种，它们都能看得见，而且，虽然比不上其它夜间捕猎动物，但蝙蝠的的视力还是相当不错的。
[08:18.80]There are two main groups of bats, which are believed to have evolved independently of each other, but both from a common ancestor.<ch> 蝙蝠可以分为两大类，（人们）相信它们是独立进化的，但都来自同一个祖先。
[08:28.08]The first group, known as the mega bats, are mostly medium-sized or large bats who eat fruits, flowers, and sometimes small animals or fish.<ch> 第一类被称为巨型蝙蝠，主要是中型或大型蝙蝠，它们吃水果、花，有时也吃小动物或鱼。

[09:00.62]The second group, called micro bats, are smaller in size and mostly eat insects.<ch>第二类被称为微型蝙蝠，体型较小，主要以昆虫为食。 
[09:06.78]These species use echolocation to find their way and identify food.<ch> 这些物种利用回声定位来探路和辨别食物。

[09:20.64]When we consider the nightly lifestyle of these bats, we will see they have to be sensitive to the changing light levels because this is how they sense when to start hunting.<ch> 当我们考虑到蝙蝠昼伏夜出的生活方式时，我们就会发现，它们必须对不断变化的光线非常敏感，因为它们要凭借这种感觉来判断何时开始狩猎。
[09:32.96]Moreover, vision is used by micro bats to travel over long distances, beyond the range of echolocation.<ch>此外，微型蝙蝠利用视觉来进行超出回声定位范围的远距离移动。
[09:41.81]So the truth is, there are no bats which are naturally blind.<ch> 所以事实是，没有天生失明的蝙蝠。
[09:46.19]Some species use their sense of hearing more than their eyes as a matter of adaptation to a particular lifestyle, but their eyes are still functional.<ch>为了适应特定的生活方式，某些物种更多地使用听觉，较少使用眼睛，但是，它们的眼睛仍然是能用的。

[12:00.76]Preschool children really don't get the moral of the story.<ch> 学龄前儿童真的无法理解故事的寓意。
[12:05.26]That's because it requires that they understand how all the parts of the show fit together.<ch> 这是因为他们必须得先去了解节目的各个部分是如何结合在一起的。

[15:00.36]But I can give you several good reasons why people should remove their shoes before going inside their homes.<ch>但是我可以给你几个很好的理由，（说明）为什么人们在进家之前应该脱掉鞋子。
[15:08.21]Bacteria are everywhere.<ch> 细菌无处不在。
[15:10.39]They collect on your shoes when you walk along sidewalks, public toilet floors and even office carpets.<ch> 当你走在人行道、公共厕所的地板甚至办公室的地毯上时，它们会聚集在你的鞋子上。

[16:54.12]By kicking off your shoes before you enter the home, you are denying entry to these harmful chemicals.<ch>在进家之前脱掉鞋子，你就是在拒绝这些有害化学物质的进入。

[18:17.95]Recording Two<ch>录音二
[18:19.68]Emotions are an essential and inseparable part of our consciousness.<ch>情感是我们意识中不可或缺的一部分。 
[18:24.61]They are part of a built-in mechanism, which allows us to cope with the ups and downs of our lives both physically and mentally.<ch> 它们是一种内在机制的一部分，让我们能够在生理和心理上应对生活的起伏。
[18:32.19]When we hide our emotions and our true feelings, we stop being genuine, spontaneous and authentic in our relationships.<ch> 当我们隐藏自己的情感和真实感受时，我们在人际关系中就不再真诚、自发和真实。
[18:39.95]When we put on cultivated and polished faces in the company of others, we stop being true to ourselves.<ch> 当我们在别人面前摆出一副有教养的、优雅的面孔时，我们就不再忠于自己了。
[18:46.64]Socially, it may be a good tactic to hide our true emotions, but morally it is also a breach of faith and trust.<ch> 隐藏真实情感，从社会角度而言，这可能是个好策略，但从道德角度来说，这是对忠诚和信任的违背。
[18:54.72]Although humans are more advanced and intelligent, animals are more genuine and authentic in their behavior and responses than human beings.<ch> 虽然人类更先进、更聪明，但动物的行为和反应却比人类更真诚、更真实。
[19:04.22]The more educated we are, the less transparent and reliable we become.<ch>受教育程度越高，我们的透明度和可靠度就越低。 
[19:09.23]We are drawn to our pets because pets do not lie.<ch>我们被宠物吸引，因为宠物不会说谎。
[19:13.50]One of the first steps in dealing with emotions such as anger or fear is to acknowledge them as normal and human.<ch> 处理愤怒或恐惧等情绪的第一步是承认它们是正常的和人性的。
[19:20.95]There is nothing sinful or immoral about being emotional, unless your emotions make you inhuman, insensitive and cruel to others.<ch> 情绪化完全不是罪恶的或不道德的，除非你的情绪使你变得不人道、麻木不仁、对他人残忍。
[19:29.52]Feelings of guilt associated with emotions are more devastating and damaging than the experience of emotion itself.<ch> 与情绪相关的罪恶感比情绪本身的体验更具毁灭性和破坏性。
[19:36.53]So when you deal with the problem of emotions, you should learn not only how to control them but also how to accept them and manage the guilt and anguish arising from them.<ch>因此，当你处理情绪问题时，你不仅应该学会如何控制情绪，还应该学会如何接受情绪，以及如何管理由此产生的内疚和痛苦。
[19:48.08]Our brains are made up of a primitive inner core and a more evolved and rational outer core.<ch> 我们的大脑由一个原始的内核和一个更加进化和理性的外核组成。
[19:55.42]Most of the time, the rational part of the mind controls the information coming from the primitive core and makes its own decisions as to what to do and how to respond.<ch>大多数时候，头脑的理性部分控制着来自原始内核的信息，并自行决定做什么和如何回应。 
[20:06.04]However, during critical situations, especially when a threat is perceived, the outer core loses control and fails to regulate the impulses and instinctual responses coming from the primitive brain.<ch> 然而，在危急的情况下，特别是当感知到威胁时，外核失去掌控，无法调节来自原始大脑的冲动和本能反应。
[20:18.64]As a result, we let disturbing thoughts and emotions arise in our consciousness and surrender to our primitive behavior.<ch>结果，我们让令人不安的想法和情绪出现在我们的意识中，屈服于我们的原始行为。
[20:26.55]In times of emotional turmoil, remember that emotions arise because your senses are wired to the primitive part of your mind which is self-regulated, autonomous and spontaneous.<ch>在情绪混乱的时候，请记住，情绪的产生是因为你的感官与你头脑中自我调节、自主和自发的原始部分相连。 
[20:38.70]Your rational mind does not always deal with the messages coming from it effectively.<ch> 你的理性思维并不能总是有效地处理来自它的信息。
[20:43.67]These messages are part of your survival mechanism and should not be stifled simply because emotions are unhealthy and betray your weaknesses.<ch> 这些信息是你生存机制的一部分，不应该仅仅因为情绪是不健康的并且暴露了你的弱点而去将其扼杀。
[20:52.49]When emotions arise, instead of stifling them, pay attention to them and try to understand the messages they are trying to deliver.<ch> 当情绪出现时，不要压抑它们，要关注它们，并试着理解它们试图传递的信息。
